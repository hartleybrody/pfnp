Taught by me, Hartley Brody ðŸ˜„

The class is organized by General Assembly. More information [here](https://generalassemb.ly/education/programming-for-non-programmers-bootcamp/boston/18504).

## Sections

### Day 1
 * **What is Programming? (1hr)** We'll start by answering the most basic question of the weekend. What *is* programming? How does a computer think? What can it do? Where does code run? We'll answer some of these questions with an ice breaker exercise.

 * **Primer on HTML, CSS & JS Intro (1hr)** HTML and CSS can be thought of as instructions for the computer, but reading the code, they don't look like instructions. This is "[Declarative Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)" (same as SQL). We're not telling the computer how to draw the website on the screen, just what we want it to look like. Javascript is an example of "[Imperative Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)" where we tell the computer what we want it to do, step-by-step. Imperative Programming is also commonly used by backend programming languages, that live on the server. We'll take a look at some basic examples and do our own simple coding.

 * **Lunch (45mins)** Yum.

 * **The "Front" End (1hr)** The frontend of any web application or web site is the code that runs in the visitor's browser, as opposed to code that runs on the site's own web server. Let's take a look at the frontends of a few simple sites, using tools that our browser provides. Explore and try editing them on the fly.

 * **Building our own static websites (2hrs)** Now for the fun part. Using sublime text, we'll write our own HTML and CSS to build web pages. We'll start out by all building similar sites following a template, and then we'll get to add more content and customize them.

 * **Adding Javascript (2hrs)** Javascript brings our static websites to life. We'll write some Javascript code that interacts with the DOM and listens for events.

### Day 2
 * **The "Back" End (1hr)** Today, we're going to look at the backend, or code that runs on a web server, as opposed to on a visitor's computer. No matter what language you use on the backend, the goal is always to return HTML, CSS and JS to be run on the visitor's computer. We'll make sure we have ruby and a few other gems installed that will help us start building server-side web apps.

 * **Primer on Ruby (1hr)** Ruby is one of many languages that can be run on a web server to produce HTML, CSS and JS. It tends to be very popular and trendy, especially among startups. It also has a lot of good tools and frameworks that make the web developer's life a lot easier. We'll look at using it from the command line, before we start building web apps.

 * **Lunch (45mins)**

 * **Intro to Sinatra (4hrs)** We're going to use the [Sinatra web framework](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) to build a simple web app. It comes with a lot of [builtin helpers](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Helpers) to handle things like cookies, sessions and databases. Time permitting, we'll touch lightly on each of these and build a mini blogging engine for storing posts.

 * **Web Development Workflow (1hr)** Before we wrap up, we'll touch on a few more topics that are essential to web development. We'll look at the day-to-day workflow of the average web developer, and some other tools and resources that can make us more productive.

## Objectives
By the end of the class, every student should be able to....

 1. ...explain what programming is.
 2. ...explain the client-server model and the difference between the "front" & "back" ends.
 3. ...write HTML and CSS to change how a webpage looks.
 4. ...write Javascript to change how a webpage behaves.
 5. ...write some backend ruby code to control what the frontend looks like.
 6. ...explain how to store data in a session cookie and a database.
 7. ...explain the day-to-day workflow of the average developer.

 2. Illustrate the concept of coming up with and executing simple instructions.
 3. Build and demonstrate a static web page using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
