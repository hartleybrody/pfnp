Taught by me, Hartley Brody ðŸ˜„

The class is organzied by General Assembly. More information [here](https://generalassemb.ly/education/programming-for-non-programmers-bootcamp/boston/18504).

## Day 1

### What is Programming?
We'll start by answering the most basic question of the weekend. What *is* programming?

How does a computer think? What can it do? Where does code run? 

We'll answer some of these questions with an ice breaker exercise.

### Web Sites vs Web Apps
You're probably familiar with a few websites and web apps that you use every day.

What are the differences between them? What do they have in common?

### The "Front" End
The frontend of any web application or web site is the code that runs in the visitor's browser, as opposed to code that runs on the site's own web server.

Let's take a look at the frontends of a few simple sites, using tools that our browser provides.

Tomorrow, we'll look at the backend. (ATM analogy)

### HTML vs CSS vs Javascript
HTML and CSS can be thought of as instructions for the computer, but reading the code, they don't look like instructions. This is "[Declarative Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)" (same as SQL). We're not telling the computer how to draw the website on the screen.

Javascript is an example of "[Imperative Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)" where we tell the computer what we want it to do, step-by-step. This is also commonly used by backend programming languages, that live on the server.

### Building our own websites!
Now for the fun part. Using sublime text, we'll create an HTML file as well as some CSS and Javascript to build our own web pages.

We'll start out by all building similar sites following a template, and then we'll get to add more content and customize them.
